# Vib Plugins

Random [vib](https://github.com/vanilla-os/vib) plugins I wrote for testing or experimenting.

## Plugins:
- `shim` A plugin that executes a seperate program and uses the output for the Containerfile. Good for writing plugins that do not compile to .so files such as python

Each plugin directory contains a readme with more information.
